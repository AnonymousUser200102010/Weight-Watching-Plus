The food.table file is a converted food list.txt file. This new file has greater readability and reliability than the old method, which required iterating through a full list before continuing to another. Obviously this has the potential to break and cause problems.
The new format is like so:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name of food
Serving size of food
Calories per serving of food
definer of food
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You're allowed to use all normal characters, upper and lower case; numbers and letters
You're forbidden from using special characters by design. Using them caused too much trouble and so they are disallowed for the time being.
