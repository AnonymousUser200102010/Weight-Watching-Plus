Update 4:

Highlights
-- FxCop installed and used to update and optimize code.
-- Folder tree restructuring.

Developer Exclusive Highlights
-- Regions added where appropriate for easier traversal of code. (May not be fully completed as of this update)
-- Serious readability restructuring.

Features:
-- Diary feature implemented, making food tracking 1/3rd complete.
-- Officially removed food table.txt to food.table conversion support. I don't feel it is required any longer. But if you must convert, I've supplied a converter. I don't know if it works, but it should.

Assets:
-- UniversalHandlersLibrary added. This library contains code for message to file and error to file support, as well as the custom contains method.

Bug Fixes:
-- Diary would not catalogue negative values. This, as well as a few aesthetic features, has been fixed.

Update 3:

Highlights:
-- Update notes started
-- Midnight snacking penalty added
-- Isolated Global Variables to it's own file, hopefully with greater reliability.
-- Set validators for the "foodPropertiesSwitch" function which makes sure there is a value in each text box/numeric_up_down else it stops the user.
-- Added rudimentary error handler for message boxes. Moved to it's own file and I plan to add to it later.
-- Validation class added...A new class for use with functions whose primary purpose is verification and validation, but who don't have a more pressing function.
-- A myriad of structural, practical and readability fixes.
