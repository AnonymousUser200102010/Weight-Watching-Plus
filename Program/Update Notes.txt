Update 4:
-- FxCop installed and used to update and optimize code.
-- Diary feature implemented, making food tracking 1/3rd complete.

Update 3:

Highlights:
-- Update notes started
-- Midnight snacking penalty added
-- Isolated Global Variables to it's own file, hopefully with greater reliability.
-- Set validators for the "foodPropertiesSwitch" function which makes sure there is a value in each text box/numeric_up_down else it stops the user.
-- Added rudimentary error handler for message boxes. Moved to it's own file and I plan to add to it later.
-- Validation class added...A new class for use with functions whose primary purpose is verification and validation, but who don't have a more pressing function.
-- A myriad of structural, practical and readability fixes.
