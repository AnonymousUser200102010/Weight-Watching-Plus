Current arguments and what they do:

"-clearcache" -- clears all files excluding food.table, food.bku, and any Error.dmp files before starting the program. This does not prevent them from being made again.

"-noexplaination" -- prevents a food.table explanation file from being created. Does not remove the file, it simply prevents it from being made if it doesn't already exist.

"-nobackup" -- prevents the automatic backup of your critical program files from the Files/Text/ folder. While this can decrease load time it is strongly advised that you do not use it.
